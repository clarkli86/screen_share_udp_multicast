Screen Share in Qt (Work in progress)
------------------
This is the project that I did for Linux programming back 10 years
ago using Qt. It now has been updated from Qt3 to Qt5...

The main features are:
* Capture the screenshot on server
* Data screnshots to multiple clients using UDP multicast

Unfortunately due to Qt API changes, it needs some fixes around:
* Popup menu
* Resize of client window
